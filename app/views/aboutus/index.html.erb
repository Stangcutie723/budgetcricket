<h3>Who are we?</h3>

<p>We are two Ruby on Rails developers in a bootcamp trying to make it into the world; one cricket story at a time.</p>

<h3>What are we doing?</h3>

<p>Uh, we're totally carving our way into the tech field by creating web apps that hopefully will win everyone's hearts over.</p>

<h3>Why are we doing it?</h3>

<p>WHY? More like, why not?</p>

<h3>How did we get here?</h3>

<p>Diana has legs. Krystle has a car and a bus pass.</p>
