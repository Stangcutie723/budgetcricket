<h3>Who are we?</h3>
We are two Ruby on Rails developers in a bootcamp trying to make it into the world; one cricket story at a time.
<p></p>

<h3>What are we doing?</h3>
Uh, we're totally carving our way into the tech field by creating web apps that hopefully will win everyone's hearts over.
<p></p>

<h3>Why are we doing it?</h3>
WHY? More like, why not?
<p></p>

<h3>How did we get here?</h3>
Diana has legs. Krystle has a car.
